            <h2>How Football Started</h2>
            <p>
                Football, also known as soccer in some countries, is a sport that has been played for centuries, with its roots tracing back to ancient civilizations. Various cultures had their own version of a ball game, but modern football as we know it began in the 19th century in England. It evolved from earlier versions of rugby and other ball games played in schools and communities.
            </p>
            <p>
                The first set of rules for the game was drafted in 1863 by the Football Association in England, which led to the creation of the distinct sport of football. These rules separated football from rugby, focusing on kicking the ball with feet and eliminating the use of hands.

            <h2>About Football</h2>
            <p>
                Football is the most popular sport in the world, with millions of people playing and watching it across the globe. The game is played by two teams of eleven players each, using a spherical ball. The objective of the game is to score goals by getting the ball into the opponent’s net, and the team with the most goals at the end of the game wins.
            </p>
            <p>
                Football is known for its simplicity — all you need is a ball and a flat surface to play. Its universal appeal stems from the fact that it can be played anywhere, by anyone, regardless of age, gender, or background. Major football tournaments like the FIFA World Cup and UEFA Champions League attract billions of viewers and have a massive global fan base.
