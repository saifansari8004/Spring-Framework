            <h2>How Cricket Started</h2>
            <p>
                Cricket is a bat-and-ball game that originated in England during the late 16th century. It is believed that the game was first played by children in the south-east of England, but by the 17th century, it had become an adult pastime. The game gained popularity and was formalized in 1744 when the first laws of cricket were established.
            </p>
            <p>
                Over time, cricket evolved and became a structured sport with recognized rules and organized competitions. By the 18th century, it had become England's national sport, and it soon spread to other countries as part of the British Empire. The first international match was played between the United States and Canada in 1844, while the first test match between England and Australia took place in 1877.

                Cricket is a team sport played between two teams of eleven players each on a circular or oval field. At the center of the field is a 22-yard long rectangular pitch where most of the action takes place. One team bats while the other bowls and fields, with the aim of scoring runs for the batting team and dismissing the players for the fielding team.

                The game has three major formats: Test cricket, One-Day Internationals (ODIs), and Twenty20 (T20). Test cricket, the traditional form of the game, can last up to five days, while ODIs are limited to 50 overs per side, and T20 is the shortest format, with 20 overs per side.
            </p>
            <p>
                Cricket is immensely popular in countries such as India, Australia, England, Pakistan, South Africa, and the West Indies. Major cricket tournaments like the ICC Cricket World Cup, The Ashes, and the Indian Premier League (IPL) attract millions of fans worldwide.
